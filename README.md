# Password_Guess
A simple password solver I built test the strength of the passwords I created with my Password_Creator program.

1. Program Prompts the user in Terminal for a password to crack 
2. It then provides the user with an estimate as to how long it will take it to crack giving the user the option (yes/no) to Crack it
3. Program then cracks the password and returns the amount of guesses and length of time taken to crack the code


ATTENTION!!! THIS PROGRAM WAS BUILT FOR PERSONAL HARMLESS TESTING AND IS NOT DESIGNED OR INTENDED TO BE USED IN ANY MALICIOUS CAPACITY!!!!
